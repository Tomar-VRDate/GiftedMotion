Introduction
============

This simply is a "better version" of the old GiftedMotion animator program, created by OnyxBits. 

Eventually, through slow additions, that'll develop into more of a "Version 2.0" of GiftedMotion. I think the ultimate goal is to create an applet version and perhaps specialize the software in gif editing and compositing rather than the original purpose of simply compiling gifs from files.

To Do
=====
* WebP support
* UNDO!!!!
* Add JMF or something so it can decode videos to gif
* Add a youtube downloader, in conjunction with the aforementioned decoder
* Maybe add an image editor (ganked from someone else's project), though that could be outsourced to the OS default.
* 3D? Ehhh.. nah.
* Load multiple projects in one workspace and allow copying of frames
* Get a faster gif encoder, holy crap.
* Get a less buggy gif decoder, amazingly Java's pack-in one is rubbish.
* Create an in-browser applet (or webstart)
* Probably overkill but allow publication directly to reddit or imgur

Differences from the Vanilla Version
=================

* Windows can't float away, forever unusable
* Buttons are more accurately disabled/enabled based on the state
* Resources file edited to be more logical.
* Removed crucify languages that really aren't necessary.
* Fixed an annoying bug in the sequence editor
* Added drag-n-drop from the filesystem
* Added a tool system
* Rotate tool
* Resize tool
* Image deoptimizer
* Crippledly loads malformed gifs, whereas the original doesn't at all
* Onionskinner (userful for creating stabilizations)
* Able to add more frames during a project, instead of overwriting all of your work.
